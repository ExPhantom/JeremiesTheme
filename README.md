# Jeremie's Theme
<!-- TODO: Same thing only better... -->
A theme for [FontForge](http://fontforge.github.io/).

# Help
I need your help! If you're a designer or just want to help design a better theme for FontForge, don't hesitate. I'm not a designer, I just want the program I use to make fonts to be pretty. And there's not just the icons to make. You can test it on your platform and signal any issue you encounter so that I can fix it. Or you can try and work withe the UI editor in FontForge, but it's wuite difficult to use.

# About the icons
If you want to help design the icons, you can do that in `Menu Icons (16x).psd` and in `Palette Icons (24x).psd`

# Installation
<!-- TODO: Same thing only better... -->
Before you do anything, I recommend that you backup your pixmaps folder. Otherwise you won't be able to deactivate the theme.

1. Copy the content of the pixmaps folder into the appropriate folder
  * Windows : `C:\Program Files (x86)\FontForgeBuilds\share\fontforge\pixmaps`
  * Mac : `//TODO`
  * Linux : `//TODO`
2. Copy `jd.theme` somewhere into the FontForge files
3. Open FontForge and go to `File -> Settings` and then find `jd.theme`.
4. Close and reopen FontForge and you're done!
