# Jeremie's Theme
A theme for FontForge.

# Installation
<!-- TODO: Same thing only better... -->
Before you do anything, I recommend that you backup your pixmaps folder. Otherwise you won't be able to deactivate the theme.

1. Copy the content of the pixmaps folder into the appropriate folder
  * Windows : `C:\Program Files (x86)\FontForgeBuilds\share\fontforge\pixmaps`
  * Mac : `//TODO`
  * Linux : `//TODO`
2. Copy `jd.theme` somewhere into the FontForge files
3. Open FontForge and go to `File -> Settings` and then find `jd.theme`.
4. Close and reopen FontForge and you're done!
